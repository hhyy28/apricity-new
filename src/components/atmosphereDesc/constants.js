  description: `Look up, to the deep but lighthearted emerald flame, leaves whistle verses on the sun-dappled paper. In this verdant rhyme, the present pulses with vitality, each rustle a note in the unfolding scene. Fountain Pen, a storyteller on parchment of time, capturing moments, toes dipped in bygone waters, heads dreaming of futures being told. A brilliant new perspective is whispered to your ears.`,
